Six exercises from the Odin Project to learn CSS principles.

1. Style three different elements using the three methods of adding CSS (External/Internal/Inline)
2. Use both class and id selectors to style different elements
3. Grouping selectors. Create buttons with some shared styling and some unique.
4. Chaining selectors. Chain selectors together so each image has a unique style applied
